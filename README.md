# Pi-Zero-W-Frame

Connect your digital frame to a WebDAV server such as Nextcloud using a Raspberry Pi Zero W. The RPi Zero W acts as a USB storage device that plugs into any USB plug-and-play supported digital frame and pictures are automatically downloaded to the Pi's mounted USB container file. All of the setup is configured through the Pi Zero W Frame's web interface and the URL address to access the setup will be provided to you after following the installation procedure below on your Raspberry Pi Zero W.

NOTE: I couldn't get this project to work with my digital frame. The Pi Zero W gets set up as a mass storage device, but the frame wouldn't recognize it. Your digital picture frame might have the same issue and if it does, then I won't be able to help you because I spent days trying to get it to work on my end and was unsuccessful. I do know that you will need a digital frame with a plug-and-play feature to play slideshows off the USB flash drive. This plug-and-play feature is not universally offered. Itâ€™s mostly found among mid-range and premium digital frames. Also, note that most mid-range frames limit the maximum supported capacity to around 16GB. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/ap7v2l/breathe_new_life_into_an_old_digital_picture/">This Reddit post</a> discusses using a Pi Zero W with a digital picture frame.
